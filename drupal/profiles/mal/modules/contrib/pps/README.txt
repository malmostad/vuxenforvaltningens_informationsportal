-- SUMMARY --

The Panel pane suggestions module allows you to easily define additional
template suggestions for panel panes.
In example, if you would like to output some block panes without title, you may
simply add a template named "panels-pane--block--no-title.tpl.php" to your theme
and configure the corresponding panes to use this template.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

The Panels module needs to be enabled.

-- CONFIGURATION --

  the pane and set the name of the template to use.
