### Zentropy - The ultimate responsive HTML5 base theme ###

This is the root of your sub-theme.

It contains your .info file, where you can edit settings like:
  * Theme regions
  * Additional stylesheets
  * Media queries (responsive stylesheets)
  * Additional javascript files
  * Default theme settings

NOTE: Zentropy *MUST* be enabled for your subtheme to work properly!

TIP: Try browsing through your theme's folder and check out the many README.txt files in each folder! :)

TIP: Check out you theme settings page to tweak your theme's settings.
